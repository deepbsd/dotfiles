# Dotfiles for deepbsd

Since I started using i3wm there have been more dotfiles to keep track of.  I
have found it useful to keep track of them especially since I now have about 15
boxes running at the house.  I'm having greater need to actually try to make
them work somewhat the same, at least where it comes to i3wm.  Also, since I'm
jusing i3wm, there are far more terminal applications I'm enjoying, nearly all
of which have their own dotfiles for configuration.
