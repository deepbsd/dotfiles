# Dotfiles for deepbsd

Since I started using i3wm there have been more dotfiles to keep track of.  I
have found it useful to keep track of them especially since I now have about 15
boxes running at the house.  I'm having greater need to actually try to make
them work somewhat the same, at least where it comes to i3wm.
